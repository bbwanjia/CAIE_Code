.SH NAME
.PP
cpc - An interpreter for CAIE Pseudocode.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]cpc\f[R] [\f[I]FILE_PATHS\f[R]] [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]cpc\f[R] is a simple interpreter for \f[I]C\f[R]AIE
\f[I]P\f[R]seudo\f[I]c\f[R]ode written in Python3.
The language regulated by CAIE has a really retro grammar and even some
grammar will not benefit both developers and the interpreter.
Thus, some unimportant grammars are changed in this interpreter and even
some new grammars are added.
For more detailed information about this, you may look at README or
<https://github.com/iewnfod/CAIE_Code>.

.SS 3. Responsibilities
.PP
3.1.
Distribution of Source Form
.PP
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License.
You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered
Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
obtain a copy of this License.
You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients\[cq] rights in
the Source Code Form.
.PP
3.2.
Distribution of Executable Form
.PP
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
.IP "(a)" 4
such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
of distribution to the recipient; and
.IP "(b)" 4
You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
recipients\[cq] rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
.PP
3.3.
Distribution of a Larger Work
.PP
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software.
If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work
governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
either this License or such Secondary License(s).
.PP
3.4.
Notices
.PP
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
.PP
3.5.
Application of Additional Terms
.PP
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
Contributor.
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred
by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.
You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
liability specific to any jurisdiction.
.SS 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
.PP
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect.
Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.
.SS 5. Termination
.PP
5.1.
The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if
You fail to comply with any of its terms.
However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this
License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your
grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify
You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after You have come back into compliance.
Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice
of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You
become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
.PP
5.2.
If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.
.PP
5.3.
In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.
.SS 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
.PP
Covered Software is provided under this License on an \[lq]as is\[rq]
basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or
statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered
Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose
or non-infringing.
The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered
Software is with You.
Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
correction.
This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
License.
No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except
under this disclaimer.
.SS 7. Limitation of Liability
.PP
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable
to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost
profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if
such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from such party\[cq]s negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation
may not apply to You.
.SS 8. Litigation
.PP
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party\[cq]s ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.
.SS 9. Miscellaneous
.PP
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof.
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
this License against a Contributor.
